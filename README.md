Technologies used: <br>

1-Room: This library is an sqlite library to create our sql queries and tables easily.
<br>
2-Datastore: This library is is a new way of storing small data. Like Password,settings etc. (Shared Preferences Deprecated)
<br>
3-Navigation Component: This library makes our fragment works easier. I used this library to pass between fragments and used animation for fragment transitions very easily thanks to this library.
<br>
4-Hilt: This library used for dependency injection it saves us from boilerplate code. In this project it looks not big matter. But in bigger projects it is a lifesaver.
<br>
5-Recyclerview: Recyclerview is a new way of showing data on the screen as a list. It is much more efficient than listview.
<br>
